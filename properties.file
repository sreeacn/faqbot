understandingRole=Each of the Talent Segments in Accenture Technology in Ireland has a Talent Practice Lead. These Leads act as advocates for their Talent Segments and are responsible for the growth of key talent. This includes sponsoring capability development activities, encouraging knowledge sharing and ensuring effective scheduling/recruitment and demand management for the people in their Talent Practice. Talent Practice Group Leads support the formal Performance Achievement process by communicating the skill growth and expectations of roles within their areas and working with Career Counsellors to provide the most appropriate talent actions for Accenture Technology people. Help to broaden your understanding by connecting with your peers through community events and activities.
identifyPeopleOfSameRole=By using the Advanced Search on people.accenture.com, you can identify people by their role and geography. Each Talent Segment has a Practice Group Lead whose role includes fostering Talent Segment community events and activities. By contributing to the Talent Practice Group community, you will naturally meet and form a support network with others within the same Role Family. Reach out to the Lead and offer to get involved in one of their target initiatives.
attendingTechnologyEvents=As we have mentioned, promotion readiness is assessed from many different factors—operating at level, business need and affordability, key elements in who contributing to business growth. <br><br>Being an active member of the Accenture Technology community and your practice within that is expected of all our people. But , there are many ways to achieve this, including actively participating in events, creation of knowledge-sharing content, participation in recruiting activities, mentoring/training others, and your contribution to market relevance (certification, business development, industry placement). Participation in your practice/community can also present opportunities to demonstrate some of the attributes of the next level, which may not be possible in your assigned role. <br><br>Events are a great way to network, learn more about your colleagues and the work they do, to build your skills and to establish yourself and be recognised for what you want to be known for. 
roleFamilyAndTalentDiscussions=Your scheduled, annual Talent Discussion will focus on how you are performing and developing your career in your current Role Family and includes discussion around or moving into a different role, if appropriate. We place the emphasis on helping you to develop specialist skills while making sure that Accenture can draw on the right skills and experience across all our whole organisation to deliver the capabilities that meet our clients’ needs.
nonAlignedRoleAndPromotion=On the contrary! Undertaking an assigned role that is different from your Role Family may open up additional promotion opportunities that you may not have considered. For example, you could gain the skills you need to be promoted into another Role Family or foundational skills that demonstrate your ability to learn and build new skills that would help you to be successful across a broader range of tasks. <br><br><br><br>If you are consistently in an assigned role which is not aligned with your Role Family, discuss with your Career Counsellor if this is the right approach for you. As you become more senior, this situation could reflect a limited business need for that role and you may need to be more proactive, along with others in your network, to create new client opportunities that could boost demand for that role. Whether you are working in an assigned role that is, or is not, aligned with your Role Family, if promotion is important to you then you should take the lead in discussing with your Career Counsellor and Line Manager what operating at the next level means for you—and how you can demonstrate that through your project work and/or other activities.
nonMatchingRole=At some point in their career, most Accenture Technology people find themselves working on projects that are outside of their Role Family This is beneficial for three reasons: <br><br>• Assigned roles can introduce you to new skills and experience and ensures you are stretching yourself in a way that aligns to your career aspirations. <br><br>• Many senior roles at Accenture require a broad understanding of technology and technology delivery, so being open to roles that are outside your Role Family for short periods of time (say 6 to12 months) will boost the scope of your knowledge. Note: if the period is any longer, you should consider whether your career aspirations are aligned to your assigned role or your Role Family.<br><br>• If you decide that you are better suited to the assigned work, you may want to realign your Role Family so that you are offered the right training opportunities and future assigned roles are relevant to your development. Your career counsellor can support you here. <br><br><br><br>If you want to stay in your current Role Family, you are responsible for being fully aware of what is expected of you. You can review role specific expectations on the Technology Careers Collection . If you feel you are not developing the skills and experience you need through your assigned project role, either seek out a project role that is better aligned with your Role Family or, if that is not achievable in the time frame, gain new skills and experience by becoming involved in Account-level activities, through your Talent Practice Group or other communities, and through Accenture Technology in Ireland community activities.  
roleDictation=Whatever your current Role, having the required experienced is a prerequisite for any promotion. <br><br>For some, it will be a natural progression to be promoted within their existing Role Family rather than into a different Role Family. This is because your role determines the training that will be automatically recommended to you as well as the assigned roles that others may offer you. However, where appropriate, the career model does support promotions into another Role Family. For example, you can be promoted from a Project Control Services Team Lead (Level 9) to a Program and Project Management Associate Manager (Level 8) if you are able to demonstrate that you have the required skills/experience and are currently performing at a level above your current career level. The skills and experience you need for a promotion into another Role Family may result from an assigned project role, formal training you have proactively engaged in, as well as experience gained through your contribution to the Technology Community, or to your contribution to the Account Team. <br><br>To understand the difference in expectations for different roles, use the Role Comparison tool under “Careers at Accenture” on https:// careerconnection.accenture.com - and you should also talk to your Career Counsellor, Line Manager, and other people you respect in the Role you would like to move into. Participating in your Talent Practice Group will help you to get to know people in other Roles in your Talent Segment. <br><br>You should be aware that, ultimately, promotions are linked to business affordability and business need, in addition to your performance. 
peopleAlignedToCD&O=The primary objective of our Career Model is that we are ONE technology. Historic focus on the Career Track has created an unnecessary disparity—creating segmentation in ways that were not always constructive to building a cohesive Accenture Technology team. To facilitate pride for ALL Accenture Technology groups, Technology Careers will focus on Roles with the Career Track taking a back seat.
moveBtweenDTES=The primary driver of where you are aligned is the type of work you do or want to do. We believe people should be where they experience a best fit, enabling them to deliver their best performance and really thrive. The work we do in Accenture Technology in Ireland differs from Consulting, Digital and Strategy and Operations. Moving from Accenture Technology to another business, such as Consulting or Digital, necessitates a formal interview process where you will be required to show you fully understand the difference in the type of work you will do in that new area. You will also be asked to illustrate that you have the skills required to be successful in that chosen area of the business. A move to another part of the Accenture business is likely to require a different career track (for example, Client and Market) and involve a change in Career Counsellor.

movingTOHigherLevels=To move to more senior Career Levels, you will need to take on additional responsibility and increase your degree of impact—but what that responsibility and impact will look like may differ depending on your role. It is important to understand the different definitions of size of team or work effort depending on your speciality. If you are taking on a project management role, it is reasonable to assume you will need to develop people management skills to do the job and perform at a certain level. Conversely, for other roles, such as Technology Architecture projects, you may be required to manage large-medium work efforts with increasing complexity of that work effort (although the number of people in the team are likely to be smaller). <br><br>To show that you can manage a large work effort you may be able to increase the workload in your current project (for example, through training, running team meetings, project financials). You might also explore opportunities to increase your responsibilities on your account team, within your Talent Segment, or area of specialism (managing training and certifications etc). <br><br>At Accenture, people development is hugely important, so think about how you can develop your people skills and look for opportunities to mentor or train others or take on a role within the Technology community in Ireland which supports capability development more broadly.
promotionConsideration=Promotion decisions will be based on your performance, affordability and the business need for the role.
trainingForRole=Yes, your combined Talent Segment, Role Family and Career Level define the core training that is suggested via myLearning. An overview of core training for all Talent Segments and Career Levels can be found later in this section. <br><br>Core training acts as “the basics” for your role and level. Typically, core training is supplemented with Specialist Training, as well as Professional Skills, NEW IT, Ethics and Compliance and Performance Achievement training. We encourage you to actively grow your technology skills by deepening your current level of expertise, increasing certification, or expanding your knowledge by learning about new technologies, methods or industries. <br><br>Accenture Technology offers a wealth of training opportunities that are delivered in a variety of ways— access to learning boards, classroom based training, training on-the-job, mentoring and hackathons are great ways to develop skills. Accenture also provides support for external study and certifications where there is business justification.
